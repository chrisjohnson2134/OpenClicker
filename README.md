# OpenClicker

Why did I make this? I have always enjoyed clicker games, I also thought that they were a waste of time. I tried to make my own clicker game once and I couldn't get it right, these games are simply a design of people of genius. I used auto clickers because I wanted to experience these games, and they helped me do that. I'm sorry to the developers and designers that spent a lot of time making me spend a lot of time. 

So to repay these people, I made my own auto-clicker. It did not take me an eternity, like I'm sure it did you guys, but now I can finally use my own talents to play your games.

# Is it done

The answer is probably no, but currently you can record your mouse clicks and play them back - by this, I mean click on the screen and then press play to have it click those same places. The delay time will speed up or slow down the time between clicks, and the default for any inavlid number is 100 ms. If you set the hold time for a particular click, it will keep the mouse held for the desired number of ms.

You can repeat clicks over whatever the mouse is hovering over. The click time is again tied to the delay time, default again to 100ms if you have an issue.

Finally, the reset button resets the app and clears out the place that you want to click in playback. 

Please enjoy. Any questions or comments, feel free to reach out. Any improvements, send me a PR.
